Hello,

My name is Joao Pedro Schmitt and I'm a Software Engineering with experience in back-end and optimization systems.
I started my carrer in 2012 as an IT help-desk and evolved to become a Cloud Engineer at Critical Techworks | BMW Group.
I love working with technology and science, my main areas of interest are robotics, distributed systems, combinatorial optimization, computer science, and algorithms.
As a hobby I like to conduct personal projects to learn new skills, share my experience as a developer this far, and sometimes contribute to some open-source projects.
