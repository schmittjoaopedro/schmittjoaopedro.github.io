Hello,

My name is Joao Pedro Schmitt and I'm a Software Engineering with experience in back-end and optimization systems.
I started my carrer in 2012 as an IT help-desk and evolved to become a Cloud Engineer at Critical Techworks | BMW Group.

I love working with technology and science, my main areas of interest are robotics, distributed systems, combinatorial optimization, computer science, and algorithms.
As a hobby I like to conduct personal projects to learn new skills, share my experience as a developer this far, and sometimes contribute to some open-source projects.

You can find more about me by [e-mail](mailto:schmittjoaopedro@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-pedro-schmitt-60847470/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/schmittjoaopedro)
