Hi there,

My name is Joao Pedro Schmitt and I'm a Senior Software Engineering with strong experience in back-end systems and cloud computing.
I started my carrer in 2012 as an IT help-desk and now I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Pagefreezer Software Inc..

I love working with technology and science, my main areas of interest are robotics, distributed systems, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, computer science, and algorithms.
As a hobby I like to conduct personal projects to learn new skills, share my experience as engineer, and from time-to-time contribute to open-source projects.

You can find more about me by [e-mail](mailto:schmittjoaopedro@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-pedro-schmitt-60847470/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/schmittjoaopedro)
